1. There is a fault in the program at the line
for ( int i = 1 ; i <attendance_records.size( ); ++i ) {
The loop should start at 0, but in this case it starts at 1.
This means that the first lectures attendance is not counted at all.

2. A test case that would not execute the fault would not exist. Since the program requires
an array of 10 ints. When given the array the first value would always not be counted in
the program, resulting in executing the fault.

3. A test case that would execute the fault but not result in an error state
would be: [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] Since the first attendance was marked as
present, the fault would be executed, but since the amount of absences is correct, the
test case does not result in an error state.

4. A test case that has an error state but not a failure would be:
[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. This set would would prodcue an error state since there
would be an incorrect number of absenses, (error state) but not a failure since
the student did not miss three classes with or without the fault.

5. A test case resulting in a failure would be:
[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] Since the first value would not be accounted for
the student would pass the class. This is a direct failure since the student missed
three classes meaning he should have failed.

Given Code:

bool fail_lecture(const vector<int>& attendance_records) {
    int absent_count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < attendance_records.size(); ++i) {
        absent_count += (attendance_records[i] == 0);
    }
    return absent_count >= 3;

Fixed Code used for testing

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool fail_lecture(const vector<int>& attendance_records) {
    int absent_count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < attendance_records.size(); ++i) {
        absent_count += (attendance_records[i] == 0);
    }
    return absent_count >= 3;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> test = {1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1};
    cout << "End = " << fail_lecture(test) << endl;
    return 0;
}
